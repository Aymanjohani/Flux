## Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

1. **Check your notifications**
   - Stale deal alerts → Review and update today
   - New lead assignments → Respond within 24 hours
   - Follow-up reminders → Complete scheduled actions

2. **Review your pipeline**
   - Sort deals by "Next Follow-up Date"
   - Handle anything due today first
   - Update stages for any progress made yesterday

3. **Log yesterday's activities**
   - If you made calls/sent emails outside HubSpot → log them
   - Update deal notes with latest status
   - Set next follow-up dates

### Throughout the Day

- **Every contact made:** Log it in HubSpot immediately (call, email, meeting)
- **After every meeting:** Update deal stage and notes
- **When you get a response:** Update lead temperature if it changes

### End of Day (3 minutes)

- Review open tasks → complete or reschedule
- Set follow-ups for tomorrow
- Update any deals that progressed

---

## Managing Contacts

### When You Get a New Lead

1. **Check if they already exist**
   - Search by email or company name first
   - Don't create duplicates

2. **Fill in required fields:**
   - ✅ First Name, Last Name, Email (minimum)
   - ✅ Company Name
   - ✅ Phone (if you have it)
   - ✅ Job Title

3. **Fill in custom fields (new!):**
   - **Manufacturing Subsector** → What do they make?
   - **Geographic Region** → Where are they based?
   - **Lead Source Detail** → How did we get this lead?
   - **Lead Temperature** → Hot/Warm/Cold (your gut feel)

4. **Assign to owner:**
   - If from your outreach → assign to yourself
   - If inbound → will auto-assign (workflow coming)

### Updating Contact Status

**Lifecycle Stages** (HubSpot moves these automatically, but you can override):
- **Lead** → Just entered system, not contacted yet
- **Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)** → Responded to outreach
- **Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)** → Had discovery call, good fit
- **Opportunity** → Active deal in pipeline
- **Customer** → Closed won
- **Evangelist** → Happy customer, giving referrals

**When to manually update:**
- After discovery call, mark as SQL
- When deal is created, mark as Opportunity
- After project delivery, mark as Customer

### Lead Statuses (what you're actively doing)

Use these to track your current action:
- **NEW** → Just got this lead
- **OPEN** → Working on it
- **IN_PROGRESS** → In active conversation
- **OPEN_DEAL** → Deal created
- **UNQUALIFIED** → Not a fit (wrong industry, budget, etc.)
- **ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT** → Reached out, no response yet
- **CONNECTED** → Had conversation, qualified
- **BAD_TIMING** → Good fit, wrong time (follow up later)

---

## Managing Deals

### Creating a Deal

**When to create:**
- After discovery call with qualified prospect
- When they request a proposal
- When they express budget + timeline

**How to create:**
1. Go to contact record
2. Click **Create** → **Deal**
3. Fill in:
   - **Deal Name:** `[Company] - [Solution Type]` (e.g., "ABC Food - MES Implementation")
   - **Amount:** Your estimate (update as you learn more)
   - **Close Date:** Their decision timeline
   - **Pipeline:** Keep default (you have one pipeline)
   - **Stage:** Start at first stage

4. **Fill custom fields:**
   - **Project Size Estimate** → Small/Medium/Large/Enterprise
   - **Decision Timeline** → Q1 2026, Q2 2026, etc.

5. **Add notes:**
   - What do they need?
   - Who are the stakeholders?
   - What's the competition?
   - Any special requirements?

### Moving Deals Through Pipeline

**Your stages (in order):**
1. **Qualification** → Validating fit, budget, timeline
2. **Discovery/Needs Analysis** → Understanding requirements
3. **Proposal/Quote** → Preparing and submitting offer
4. **Negotiation** → Discussing terms, pricing
5. **Closed Won** ✅ → Deal signed!
6. **Closed Lost** ❌ → Deal fell through

**Rules:**
- Only move forward when you complete the stage's objective
- If you skip stages, that's okay (just move to current reality)
- **Always add a note** when changing stage (why did it move?)

### Deal Hygiene

**Every 7 days, update:**
- Deal stage (if changed)
- Notes (latest activity)
- Next follow-up date
- Amount (if estimate changed)

**If deal stalls:**
- Update "Next Follow-up Date" to when you'll try again
- Set reminder in calendar
- Don't leave it sitting with no plan

**If deal dies:**
- Mark as "Closed Lost"
- Add note explaining why (pricing, timing, competitor, etc.)
- Set future follow-up if appropriate (6 months, 1 year)
