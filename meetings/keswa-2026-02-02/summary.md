**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Attendees:** Ayman Aljohani, Amro Abouzied, Aadil Feroze, Amr Elmayergy, Hamza Feroze, Abdulrahman Bajabir

## Meeting Purpose
Preparation for tomorrow's meeting with the Keswa factory team to discuss the quality inspection project implementation.

---

## Tomorrow's Meeting Attendees (Client Side)
- **Maram** - Head of Female Empowerment
- **Bandar** - IT Manager  
- **Fahad** - Factory Manager
- High-level team only (engineers will not attend)

---

## Key Project Context

### Current Setup
- Quality inspection will be done **offline** in a separate room (not on production line)
- Factory will move completed pieces to the QC room after stitching
- Current process: Quality issues are only identified at the end (no real-time correction possible due to complexity of removing good stitching)

### Future Vision
- Phase 1: Automated quality reporting with dashboard (current focus)
- Phase 2: Potential integration into live stitching line with periodic checks (requires extensive training data)

---

## Critical Data Requirements from Keswa

**High Priority - Needed ASAP:**
1. **Exact dimensions of:**
   - The bench/table that holds the piece
   - Part 6 specifications
   
2. **Quality data:**
   - Previous quality reports for Part 6
   - Raw pictures (10GB available - **request all of them**)
   - Quality criteria and measurements they currently use

3. **Design files:**
   - Guideline template/drawing (the base layer design used for stitching alignment)
   - This is printed/inked onto base cloth before stitching begins

4. **Timeline:**
   - **Critical:** When will Part 6 be finished?
   - When will it be available for quality inspection?

5. **Historical data (if possible):**
   - Old Part 6 from previous year(s) stored in warehouse
   - Would provide best training data
   - Request to use it in same room (won't leave factory)
   - **Note:** May be difficult as Keswa pieces are often cut and distributed as gifts

## What We Will Present Tomorrow

1. **Camera setup demonstration** (video from team)
   - Camera positioning, heights, specifications
   
2. **UI/Dashboard prototype** (HTML/JavaScript)
   - Built during contract signing wait period
   - Will be customized based on their requirements
   
3. **Project timeline and expectations**
   - Emphasize: Work already done, waiting on contract completion
   - Need to move fast now to be ready when Part 6 is finished

4. **Point of contact confirmation**
   - Likely Maram as primary contact

---

## Action Items

### Before Tomorrow's Meeting:
- [ ] **Amro:** Compile all discussion points, setup videos, camera specs, UI demo into presentation
- [ ] **Ayman:** Review and approve presentation materials
- [ ] **Ayman:** Join from 1 PM onwards (has SIRI assessment before that)

### Post-Meeting Actions:
- [ ] **Order camera from China via express shipping** (immediately after meeting)
  - Local supplier (Abdulaziz) not responsive/doesn't have required specs
  - Need specific camera model discussed

### Ongoing:
- [ ] Confirm point of contact with Keswa team
- [ ] Obtain all requested data from Keswa
- [ ] Align dashboard reporting structure with Keswa's current quality report format

## Key Insights & Discussions

- **Project value questioned:** Current offline QC only provides reporting, not real-time correction
  - **Response:** Phase 1 focuses on automated reporting and making QC easier for humans
  - Future phases can integrate into live production with proper training data

- **Training data critical:** The more historical quality images and actual pieces we can access, the better the model accuracy

- **Timeline pressure:** Need to be ready when Part 6 is completed - speed is essential now

- **Cultural sensitivity noted:** "No Baraka in Keswa itself - don't commit shirk" (reminder about religious perspective on the cloth)

---

## Next Steps
1. Finalize tomorrow's presentation
2. Confirm meeting logistics and attendees
3. Order camera equipment immediately after meeting
4. Prepare data collection plan based on what Keswa can provide
