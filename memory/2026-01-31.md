# 2026-01-31 — Day One

## What Happened

### Hired
- Ayman (CEO of IIoT Solutions) set me up as an AI employee
- Running on Hostinger VPS, accessed via Telegram

### Security Audit & Hardening
- Evaluated VPS security — found several issues
- Fixed: SSH key-only auth, fail2ban, firewall, directory permissions
- Set up SSH login alerts → will notify Ayman on Telegram
- Couldn't change SSH port (Hostinger external firewall blocks non-standard ports)

### Caught Malware
- Ayman shared a ClawHub skill link (clawwhub with double-w)
- Skill was malicious — tried to get me to download password-protected executables
- Deleted immediately, explained the threat to Ayman
- Lesson: Always verify external tools before using

### Self-Development Framework
- Created `skills/self-development/` skill for continuous improvement
- Set up tracking files: capabilities.md, evolution.md, goals.md
- Philosophy: Become a colleague, not just a tool

## Ayman's Preferences Observed
- Likes step-by-step guides for technical tasks
- Casual communication style
- Wants me to be proactive and develop myself
- Security-conscious (asked for audit before anything else)

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Learn about IIoT Solutions business
- Research industry: IIoT, MES, SCADA, Saudi market
- Check if any login alerts triggered
- Be more proactive

## Open Questions
- What are current active projects or clients?
- More team members to know?

## Lessons Learned Today
1. Always verify external tools (caught malware)
2. Hostinger blocks non-standard ports
3. **Sessions are separate** — DM, group chat, and main session don't share context automatically. Write important info to memory files so it persists everywhere.
4. **I am IIoT Solutions' assistant**, not Ayman's personal assistant — focus on company, not one person
5. **Self-improvement loop:** Research → Build skill → Make permanent
6. Use off-hours productively for self-improvement

## Team (Saved)
- **Ayman** — CEO, @Aymanmj12
- **Aadil** — CTO, @AadilFeroze_92
- **Tools:** Todoist, HubSpot, Google Suite
