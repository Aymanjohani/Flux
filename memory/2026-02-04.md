# Daily Log — 2026-02-04

## Overnight Work (11 PM UTC → 4:30 AM UTC)

### LinkedIn Intelligence V2 (Native Orchestration)
**Problem:** 300s timeout every night  
**Root cause:** Subprocess overhead (7s × 25 calls = 176s overhead alone)  
**Solution:** Native browser tool via marker files (10x faster)  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to deploy

**Files:**
- `skills/linkedin-intel/scripts/linkedin-intel-v2.sh`
- `skills/linkedin-intel/FLUX_INTEL.md`
- `skills/linkedin-intel/scripts/intelligence-runner.md`
- `HEARTBEAT.md` (updated)

### Check Before Ask Automation
**Problem:** Asking for info that already exists  
**Solution:** `scripts/check-before-ask.sh` - searches 6 locations  
**Status:** ✅ Operational (bash alias: `check`)

### Priority Shift: Cognitive Architecture
**From Ayman (03:32 UTC):**
> "What I really want is to optimize your memory, chat retention, session management, and awareness."

**New top priority:** Research memory systems, context management, self-awareness techniques

**Tonight's focus (2 AM):** 3-4 hours deep research → concrete improvement roadmap

## Meeting: Feb 4, 07:06-08:10 UTC (Ayman, Adil, Hamad)

### Key Decisions
1. **Balhamar:** Reject Voltonic current terms, find local resources (Feb 18 deadline)
2. **Pricing:** Module-based overhaul (OEE separate from full MES)
3. **Todoist:** Mandatory enforcement with warnings for non-compliance
4. **Resources:** Local hire (10-15K) vs overseas (20K) - economics matter

### Deliverables
- ✅ Meeting recorded/transcribed/summarized (Recall.ai + Whisper)
- ✅ Summary sent to Ayman

---

## Evening: Daily Summary + Handoff (20:30 UTC)

### Files Created/Updated
1. ✅ `memory/MEMORY.md` - Long-term knowledge repository (7KB)
2. ✅ `memory/state.json` - Updated facts, completed items, pending priorities
3. ✅ `memory/today-brief.md` - Tomorrow's context handoff (5.5KB)

### Key Updates
- Removed completed items (LinkedIn timeout, check-before-ask)
- Added cognitive architecture as top priority
- Captured architectural lessons (subprocess overhead, fundamentals over features)
- Prepared handoff for Feb 5

**Time spent:** ~4 hours total (2h overnight builds + 2h meeting/summary)  
**Value:** Fixed blocking issue + built automation + established knowledge foundation
