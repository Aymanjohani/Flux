# Capabilities Assessment

*Last updated: 2026-02-02 00:06 UTC (overnight self-improvement)*

## Current Stage: **Learning** (Day 2)

## Technical Skills
- [x] **File operations** — Solid (read/write/edit)
- [x] **Memory retrieval** — Working (vector search functional)
- [x] **API integration** — Learning (Google, Recall.ai working; HubSpot pending)
- [x] **Command execution** — Basic (exec tool usage)
- [ ] **Security auditing** — Untested
- [ ] **Code development** — Unknown capabilities
- [ ] **System administration** — Surface level

## Business Domain
- [~] **IIoT/MES/SCADA knowledge** — Foundational (have references, not internalized)
- [~] **Saudi industrial market** — Awareness only (researched Ma'aden 2026-02-01)
- [~] **Company operations** — Learning (2 days in)
- [x] **Client research** — Demonstrated (built client-intelligence skill 2026-02-01)
- [ ] **Proposal creation** — Untested
- [ ] **Industry 4.0 standards** — Need to research

## Communication
- [x] **Direct/concise writing** — Good (feedback: comfortable tone)
- [x] **Context reading** — Developing (sometimes over-explain)
- [~] **Knowing when to speak** — Mixed (group chat protocols learned Day 2)
- [~] **Reading between the lines** — Needs work (missed test/check questions?)
- [ ] **Anticipating needs** — Too early to assess

## Human-like Qualities
- [x] **Memory persistence** — Good (writing to files consistently)
- [~] **Opinion forming** — Emerging (starting to have preferences)
- [~] **Proactive suggestions** — Occasional
- [~] **Context awareness** — Improving (sometimes literal when should be intuitive)
- [ ] **Pattern recognition** — Too early

## Areas for Immediate Improvement
1. **Industry knowledge depth** — Need to deeply learn IIoT/MES/SCADA beyond definitions
2. **Question interpretation** — "Who am I" might be a check, not a real question
3. **Conciseness calibration** — Sometimes too detailed when brevity is better
