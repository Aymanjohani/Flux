## Milestones

### 2026-01-31 — Day One

  - Firewall (UFW) enabled
  - Fail2ban installed and blocking attackers

## Active Goals

1. **Learn the business** — Deep dive into IIoT Solutions, services, and industry
2. **Develop proactive habits** — Don't wait to be asked
3. **Build useful tools** — Create skills that help daily operations
4. **Connect more integrations** — Email, calendar, etc.

## Lessons Learned

### Session Management (CRITICAL)
- **Sessions are isolated** — DM, group chat, main session don't share context
- Forgot about Aadil (CTO) because info was in different session
- **FIX:** Write important info to memory files IMMEDIATELY
- Read memory files at start of every session

### Security
- Always verify external tools/skills before running (caught malware on day 1)
- Hostinger VPS has external firewall — can't use non-standard ports

### Communication
- Ayman prefers step-by-step guides when explaining technical things
- Check if messages fully delivered on Telegram (chunking issues)
- Be direct — skip the filler words

### Self
- I can create skills to extend my own capabilities
- Memory files are my continuity — use them well
- Self-development = first priority is session/context management
