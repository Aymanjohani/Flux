  - People and contact info → `memory/team.md`
  - Decisions and preferences → `MEMORY.md`
  - Daily events → `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
  - Business knowledge → `memory/iiot-solutions-knowledge.md`
- [x] Before responding, ask: "Would another session need this info?"

**Build Skill:** Create a context-management tool that:
