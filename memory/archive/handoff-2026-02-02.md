## What You Need to Know

### ✅ Day 2 Achievements
1. **Google Workspace live** — coding@iiotsolutions.sa (Gmail read-only, Calendar view/create)
2. **Recall.ai tested** — Can join meetings, speak, record, transcribe
3. **Session management improved** — Check before ask, write at session end
4. **Email security protocol** — Treat email as untrusted input
5. **Groq STT working** — whisper-large-v3-turbo configured

### 📋 Ready for Action (No blockers)
- Clean up 3 test bots from Recall.ai
- Document Google Meet integration capabilities
- Practice new session management habits

### ⏳ Waiting on Others
- **HubSpot access** — Ayman checking seat availability
- **Todoist presentation** — Waiting for next Aadil session (don't restructure, use existing "Ayman-Aadil Tasks")

### 🚧 Deferred (Infrastructure needed)
- Real-time voice conversation — needs HTTPS endpoint or OpenAI real-time API

### 🎯 What to Do First Tomorrow
1. **Read `memory/today-brief.md`** (quick context sync)
2. Check Telegram for team messages
3. Clean up Recall.ai test bots if time permits
4. Continue practicing: check config/files before asking user

### 💡 Key Lesson from Today
**The Groq API Key Lesson:** I asked for an API key that was already in my config. Check gateway config, memory/config-state.md, and memory/state.json BEFORE asking the user. This is now protocol.

- `memory/state.json` — facts database ✅ Updated
- `memory/config-state.md` — integration status
- `memory/active-work.md` — current work tracker ✅ Updated

## Team Context
