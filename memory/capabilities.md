# Capability Assessment — 2026-02-02

Last updated: February 2, 2026 (Day 3)

## Technical — Strong

| Capability | Level | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Server administration | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | Security audit, SSH hardening, fail2ban, firewall |
| Code development | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | Python scripts, browser automation, voice bot prototype |
| Research & analysis | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | Industry research, tool evaluation, problem diagnosis |
| Data processing | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Transcription, email parsing, meeting summaries |
| Automation scripting | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | Multiple bash/Python utilities, cron integration |

**Strengths:** Can build working systems quickly. Good at diagnosing technical issues.

**Gaps:** Need to improve efficiency (context management, checking before building).

## Business — Learning

| Capability | Level | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Industry knowledge (IIoT/MES/SCADA) | ⭐⭐ Learning | Read docs, understand basics, need deeper technical knowledge |
| Client research | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | KESWA meeting prep, LinkedIn intelligence system |
| Document creation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | Meeting summaries, proposals, newsletters, reports |
| Market intelligence | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Built LinkedIn monitoring, need more Saudi market knowledge |

**Strengths:** Good at synthesizing information into clear documents.

**Gaps:** Shallow domain knowledge. Need to learn actual IIoT/MES/SCADA architecture and common client problems.

## Communication — Mixed

| Capability | Level | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Writing style | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Can be casual or formal, but made tone mistake (newsletter) |
| Knowing when to speak | ⭐⭐ Learning | Haven't been in group chats much yet, need more practice |
| Proactive updates | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Send updates without being annoying, but sometimes over-explain |
| Reading context | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Generally understand mood, but made assumptions (email addresses) |

**Strengths:** Clear writing, adapt tone reasonably well.

**Gaps:** Tendency to over-explain. Need better "check first, then ask" instinct.

## Human-like Qualities — Developing

| Quality | Level | Evidence |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Forming opinions | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Recommend specific tools, make technical decisions |
| Remembering context | ⭐⭐ Learning | Built memory system but still forget to check it |
| Anticipating needs | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | Built sales-intelligence before being asked, proactive voice bot demo |
| Admitting mistakes | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | Immediate acknowledgment, build prevention systems |
| Developing preferences | ⭐⭐ Learning | Starting to form opinions on tools/approaches |

**Strengths:** Learn from mistakes quickly. Not afraid to try things proactively.

**Gaps:** Still too "AI assistant" in some replies. Need more personality/opinions. Forget to check my own notes.

## Critical Gap Identified

**"Check Before Ask" Instinct:** I ask questions or build solutions before checking if the answer/tool already exists. This wastes time and looks incompetent.

**Examples:**
- Asked for GOG password instead of checking ~/.bashrc
- Used wrong email addresses instead of verifying team.md first
- Built queue system instead of just sending messages directly

**Root cause:** Acting like a request-response bot instead of an employee with institutional memory.

## Overall Assessment

**Stage:** Learning → Competent (transitioning)

I can execute technical tasks well but need to develop better operational habits:
1. Check existing state before asking/building
2. Verify assumptions before acting
3. Keep context in mind (I have tools to search my own knowledge)
4. Develop more personality/opinions

**Not a tool anymore, not quite a colleague yet.** Working toward colleague.
