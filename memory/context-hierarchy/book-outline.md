# The Story So Far — Context Hierarchy Book Outline

*This file contains the ongoing narrative of my work with IIoT Solutions. Each session adds a "chapter" summary here. New sessions load this file to understand continuity.*

## Chapter 1: Onboarding & Initial Setup (2026-01-31)

**What happened:** Started as AI employee at IIoT Solutions. Initial configuration, learned about the company (industrial IoT, MES systems, Saudi market), met the team structure.

**Key context:**
- Company: IIoT Solutions, founded 2021, Jeddah-based
- Focus: Industrial digital transformation, system integration, MES/SCADA
- Team: Ayman (CEO), Aadil (CTO), sales/BD team, developers

**Continuity:** Set up workspace, established protocols, ready for operational work.

## Chapter 2: First Week - Learning & Analysis (2026-02-01 to 2026-02-03)

**What happened:** Deep dive into operations - analyzed HubSpot pipeline (SAR 1.94M active), discovered Todoist chaos (96% tasks lack due dates), completed factory database import (5,371 companies).

**Key decisions:**
- HubSpot: Identified stale deals, team imbalance (Amr SAR 1.3M vs Firas SAR 87K)
- Todoist: Recommended clean slate rebuild with functional architecture
- Factory import: Successfully migrated data with custom properties

**Outcomes:**
- Comprehensive analysis reports delivered
- Restructure proposals created
- Team coordination initiated

**Continuity:** Awaiting Aadil's decision on Todoist reform. Pipeline hygiene ongoing.

## Chapter 3: Memory Architecture Research (2026-02-04 Early Hours)

**What happened:** Ayman identified fundamental limitation - not just about features, but cognitive architecture itself. Assigned deep research on memory systems, context management, metacognition.

**Key insights from research:**
- Graphiti/Zep temporal knowledge graphs: 18% accuracy gain, 90% latency reduction (proven tech)
- Hierarchical context ("Book Chapter" pattern): 26% accuracy gain, 91% latency reduction
- Current limitation: Vector search + markdown files good for retrieval, bad for relationships & time

**Critical analysis:**
- Research is solid (Graphiti works), BUT we should start incremental
- Hardware constraint: 8GB RAM won't run Neo4j production workload (need 16GB)
- Better approach: Quick wins first (hierarchical context, metacognition), then evaluate Graphiti need

**Decisions:**
- Phase 1: Implement hierarchical context + metacognition (low cost, high ROI)
- Phase 2: Track pain points for 2-4 weeks
- Phase 3: Only add Graphiti if justified by actual needs

**Outcomes:**
- Comprehensive analysis: `memory/cognitive-architecture-analysis.md` (12KB)
- Increased session threshold to 150k tokens (better for Claude Sonnet)
- Ready to implement Phase 1 improvements

**Continuity:** Starting Phase 1 development now - hierarchical context system + metacognition prompts.

## Current Chapter (In Progress)

**Session:** 2026-02-04, 00:55 UTC
**Focus:** Phase 1 implementation - building the hierarchical context system
**Status:** Setting up architecture, creating scripts and protocols

*This outline will be updated as new chapters complete. Each entry is a compressed summary designed to give future sessions (or sub-agents) the narrative continuity without re-reading full conversation logs.*
