# 6-Hour Summary: 2026-02-04 06:00 UTC

**Period:** 00:00 - 06:00 UTC
**Generated:** 2026-02-04 06:00 UTC

## Summary

**Day 5** — Wednesday
## ✅ RESOLVED: Token Threshold Monitor (04:50 UTC)
**Previous issue (03:15):** Thought hook wasn't loading - no warnings seen at 69k tokens
**Resolution:** Hook WAS working, verified from logs at `/root/.openclaw/logs/token-monitor.log`:
**What happened:** Different sessions (main vs telegram DM) - warnings were firing on correct session
**Lesson:** Check ALL sessions' logs before assuming failure
---
## ✅ COMPLETED: Memory Architecture + Workspace Cleanup (01:00-01:42 UTC)
**1. Memory Architecture Testing (01:00-01:17)**
- ✅ Memory checkpoint complete (all context preserved)
- ✅ Found and fixed conversation continuity bug
- ✅ Updated protocols.md with "Active Session Continuity" section
- ✅ Architecture tested and working correctly
**2. Codebase Audit (01:31-01:37)**
- ✅ Spawned sub-agent for comprehensive workspace evaluation
- ✅ Identified 28+ files cluttering root, 6 empty skills, technical debt
**3. Workspace Cleanup (01:41-01:42)**
- ✅ Phase 1: Organized root (data→archive, scripts→ops/hubspot, demo→projects)
- ✅ Phase 2: Deleted 6 empty skills, kept 5 active
- ✅ Phase 3: Fixed memory_engine.js fallback, created missing dirs, added bash alias
**Current state:** Clean workspace, hardened memory system, production-ready

# 6-Hour Summary: 2026-02-04 12:00 UTC

**Period:** 06:00 - 12:00 UTC
**Generated:** 2026-02-04 12:00 UTC

## Summary

## 🔥 Today's Critical Actions
### 🔴 CRITICAL: Session Persistence Bug (09:55 UTC)
**Problem:** Telegram disconnects causing complete context loss
- **What happened:** Multiple times today - Telegram disconnected, new session created
- **Root cause:** OpenClaw has no peer → session mapping/restore logic
- **Impact:** Lost conversations regardless of token count (can't be solved by checkpoints alone)
**Session evidence:**
- 09:00 UTC: Session at 78k tokens discussing "option 2" solution
- 09:42 UTC: Telegram disconnects
- 09:44 UTC: New session created (lost entire conversation about this exact problem)
**Solution:** Build session-persistence hook (like token-threshold-monitor)
- Just like we built the token threshold hook ourselves, we'll build this
- Maintain peer_id → session_key mapping
- On reconnect → restore existing session instead of creating new one
- Store mapping in persistent file (survives gateway restarts)
**Status:** 🟡 Problem documented, solution designed
- **File created:** `memory/problems/session-persistence-on-reconnect.md`
- **Next step:** Build the hook (study token-threshold-monitor structure)
**Three implementation options:**
**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 - hook implementation (cleanest, most portable)
