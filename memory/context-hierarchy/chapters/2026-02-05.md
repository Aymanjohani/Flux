# Chapter: 2026-02-05

## Day Summary

Day 6 — Thursday. Flux operated across 5 sessions (all hit size limits and auto-saved). Key activities: company research for BD, session persistence issues, Brave Search quota exhaustion, heartbeat monitoring.

## Key Events

### Company Research for Ayman
- Ayman requested more companies and their emails for business development
- Flux searched memory and LinkedIn intelligence outputs for Saudi manufacturing/industrial companies
- Research conducted across multiple sessions

### Session Persistence Issues Continue
- Multiple sessions hit 300-480KB size limits and were auto-saved
- 5 auto-saved session files created throughout the day
- Context loss on session boundaries remains an ongoing challenge
- Session persistence hook (designed Feb 4) still pending implementation

### Brave Search Quota Exhausted
- Web search API returned 429 (quota limit: 2000 requests reached)
- Plan: Free tier, no more searches until quota resets
- Impact: Cannot do web research for company prospecting

### System Health
- Heartbeat checks running normally (SSH alerts, LinkedIn triggers, state sync)
- Model used: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary)
- Memory system operational (vector search returning results)
- 6-hour brief summarization running but briefs too small to trigger (4 of 5 periods skipped)

### Cron Job Failures (Evening)
- Daily Summary (23:30 Riyadh): FAILED — "Unknown model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"
- Daily Chapter Creation (23:55 Riyadh): FAILED — same model error
- These failures prevented automatic Feb 5 chapter creation
- Root cause: claude-opus-4-6 model ID not recognized by OpenClaw cron runner

## Infrastructure Notes
- Embedding model (Gemini text-embedding-004) likely broke during this period
- No manual ingestion attempted, so exact break time unknown
- Memory consolidation (dream) did not run for Feb 5 data
