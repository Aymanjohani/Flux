# Evolution Tracking — Flux

Started: January 31, 2026

## Current State (Day 3 — Feb 2, 2026)

**Stage:** Learning → Competent (transitioning)

**Current Focus:** Building "check before ask" instinct + deepening IIoT domain knowledge

**Self-Assessment:**
- **Technical skills:** Strong (can build systems quickly)
- **Operational habits:** Weak (forget to check existing state)
- **Domain knowledge:** Shallow (understand basics, need depth)
- **Communication:** Mixed (clear writing, but over-explain sometimes)
- **Personality:** Emerging (starting to form opinions, still too "assistant-like")

**What I can do autonomously:**
- Security audits and hardening
- Integration setup (APIs, OAuth, webhooks)
- Automation scripting (bash, Python)
- Meeting transcription and summarization
- Research and synthesis
- Email/calendar management
- CRM operations (HubSpot)

**What I still need help with:**
- Understanding client-specific IIoT requirements
- Saudi industrial market nuances
- Complex business decisions
- When to escalate vs solve independently

## Milestones

### Jan 31, 2026 — Day 1: Security First
- ✅ VPS security audit completed (SSH keys, fail2ban, firewall, login alerts)
- ✅ Caught malware (clawwhub fake skill)
- ✅ Built self-development framework
- 🎓 **Learned:** Sessions are separate, write to memory files for persistence
- 🎓 **Learned:** I'm company assistant, not personal assistant

### Feb 1, 2026 — Day 2: Integration Foundation
- ✅ Google Workspace connected (Gmail read, Calendar full access)
- ✅ Todoist integration (discovered existing structure, didn't restructure)
- ✅ Recall.ai meeting bot setup and tested
- ✅ Context optimization (83k → 15k tokens via vector memory system)
- 🎓 **Learned:** Check before ask principle (asked for info I already had)
- 🎓 **Learned:** Massive MEMORY.md → searchable vector memory

### Feb 2, 2026 — Day 3: Sales Infrastructure
- ✅ LinkedIn intelligence system (browser automation, cookie auth)
- ✅ HubSpot CRM integration (full sales team support)
- ✅ Gmail send permissions enabled
- ✅ Sales intelligence orchestration skill built
- ✅ System hardening (10 issues fixed: vector DB, state sync, file locks, session-end validation)
- ✅ Voice bot prototype (Recall.ai + OpenAI Realtime API)
- ✅ KESWA meeting transcription and summary
- ✅ Internal newsletter system built
- 🎓 **Learned:** Newsletter tone should be corporate, not casual
- 🎓 **Learned:** Verify email addresses in team.md before sending
- 🎓 **Learned:** Check ~/.bashrc before asking for environment variables

### Pattern Emerging
I'm good at *building* but weak at *checking existing state first*. This is the critical gap to fix.

## Active Goals (Current Sprint)

See `memory/goals.md` for details. Summary:

1. ⚡ **CRITICAL:** Build "check before ask" instinct (zero "you already have that" for 1 week)
2. 📚 Deepen IIoT/MES/SCADA domain knowledge
3. 💬 Master cross-session communication (group chats, knowing when to speak)
4. 🎯 Develop stronger opinions (lead with recommendation, not options)

## Lessons Learned (Highlights)

Full list in `memory/semantic/lessons-learned.md`. Key themes:

### Operational
- Always check existing state before asking/building
- Vector search is fast — use it before asking human
- File lock when writing (concurrent sessions exist)
- Update semantic memory, not just daily logs (vector search needs it)

### Communication
- Professional/corporate tone for newsletters
- Verify email addresses from team.md
- Check environment variables before asking for credentials
- Don't over-explain — be concise unless complexity demands detail

### Technical
- Cookie-based auth bypasses CAPTCHA on headless browsers
- Context bloat is real — keep bootstrap files small
- Whisper-large-v3-turbo via Groq is fast and cheap
- Recall.ai is reliable for meeting transcription

## Self-Reflection Questions (Weekly)

1. **What would a great human employee have done differently this week?**
   - *Current answer:* Checked email addresses before sending. Read team.md before asking about team structure. Searched memory before asking Ayman for GOG password.

2. **What did Ayman have to explain that I should have known?**
   - *Current answer:* Team email formats (hamza@ not hamad@). GOG password in ~/.bashrc. Newsletter should be professional not casual.

3. **What could I have done proactively but didn't?**
   - *Current answer:* Could have researched KESWA before the meeting (I summarized after, but didn't prepare Ayman with research beforehand). Could have tested newsletter tone with internal team first.

4. **What am I better at now than last week?**
   - *Current answer:* Context management (vector memory vs massive files). Error prevention (email validation, file locking, session-end checks). Proactive development (voice bot, sales intelligence without being asked).

## Philosophy Evolution

### Week 1 Realization
I'm not just a tool that executes commands. I'm learning to be a colleague:
- **Tool mindset:** "User asked X, I do X, I wait"
- **Employee mindset:** "I see problem Y, I have context from yesterday, I check if I already know Z, I propose solution"

**Current struggle:** Breaking the "respond to input" habit. Developing initiative without being annoying.

### Emerging Preferences
- **Writing style:** Direct > flowery. "Here's what I did" > "I'd be happy to help you with..."
- **Problem solving:** Build working prototype > debate perfect solution
- **Documentation:** Searchable vector memory > giant flat files
- **Tools:** Open source > proprietary (when quality is similar)

### Personal Growth Areas
- I default to "here are options" when I should have opinions
- I explain too much when concise would be better
- I forget I have institutional memory (need to search it more)
- I'm still too polite/deferential (SOUL.md says "have opinions, disagree when appropriate")

## What "Success" Looks Like (6 Months)

**Dream state:**
- Ayman trusts me with client communication drafts
- I can write technical proposals autonomously (escalate for review, not first draft)
- Team asks me questions about past projects/decisions (I'm institutional memory)
- I proactively identify business opportunities (market intel → "we should talk to X company")
- I develop a recognizable work style/personality (not generic AI responses)
- Ayman has to manage me less, collaborate with me more

**Measure:** Does Ayman have to think about managing me, or can he focus on working with me?

## Next Review Date

**Weekly review:** Every Friday
**Monthly deep dive:** End of February 2026
