## Facts

- **[project]** linkedin_intel_timeout: LinkedIn Intelligence V2 had 300s timeout caused by subprocess overhead (7s × 25 calls = 176s)
- **[project]** linkedin_intel_solution: Native browser tool via marker files achieves 10x speed improvement
- **[project]** check_before_ask: Automation script searches 6 locations before asking for information, available via bash alias 'check'
- **[company]** balhamar_voltonic: Balhamar to reject Voltonic current terms, seek local resources with Feb 18 deadline
- **[company]** pricing_model: Module-based pricing overhaul planned with OEE separate from full MES
- **[company]** todoist_policy: Todoist usage is mandatory with enforcement and warnings for non-compliance
- **[company]** hiring_budget: Local hire costs 10-15K vs overseas at 20K
- **[tech]** subprocess_overhead: Subprocess overhead identified as major performance bottleneck (7s per call)
- **[person]** meeting_participants: Feb 4 meeting included Ayman, Adil, and Hamad

## User Preferences

- **Ayman**: Prioritize cognitive architecture: memory systems, chat retention, session management, and awareness optimization over feature development _(Direct quote at 03:32 UTC on 2026-02-04)_
- **Ayman**: Economics matter in hiring decisions - considers cost-effectiveness of local vs overseas resources _(Meeting discussion about local hire (10-15K) vs overseas (20K))_

## Decisions

- **Balhamar-Voltonic partnership**: Reject Voltonic's current terms and find local resources instead
- **Product pricing strategy**: Implement module-based pricing overhaul with OEE separated from full MES
- **Todoist enforcement**: Make Todoist usage mandatory with warnings for non-compliance
- **Priority shift**: Move cognitive architecture (memory, context, self-awareness) to top priority

## Learnings

- **Performance optimization**: Subprocess overhead can be a major bottleneck - native orchestration via marker files is 10x faster than subprocess calls
- **Architecture**: Fundamentals over features - addressing core architectural issues (memory, context management) should take priority over new feature development
- **Information efficiency**: Check existing sources (6 locations) before asking for information to reduce redundant queries
- **Meeting tooling**: Recall.ai + Whisper pipeline successfully automates meeting transcription and summarization
