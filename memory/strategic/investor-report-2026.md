### 2025 Dip Explained
Intentional R&D investment year. Revenue declined while team focused on platform development (MES, EMS, IoT Logix), resulting in **3M+ SAR IP asset**. Strategic investment, not operational failure.

---

## Government Validation

### Ministry of Industry (MIM) - Approved MES Provider ✅

**Status:** Official certification as Ministry-approved MES provider

**Evidence:** Ministry approval letter on file

**Impact:** 
- Listed on government digitization incentive program
- Factories receive subsidies to adopt our solution
- Significantly reduces customer acquisition friction
- Government backing validates credibility

**Strategic Value:** This certification is a moat - competitive advantage that's hard to replicate.

---

## Strategic Partnerships

### Intek (Anchor Channel Partner) 🎯

**Status:** Verbal LOI | Written LOI targeting Q1 2026

**Ownership:** Joint venture between:
- **MODON** (Saudi industrial cities authority)
- **Giza Systems** (largest systems integrator in MENA)

**Access:** 12,500+ factories across MODON industrial cities:
- Sudair Industrial City
- Jubail Industrial City
- KAEC (King Abdullah Economic City)
- Additional cities

**Revenue Contribution:** 40-50% of integrator channel revenue by 2030

**Strategic Importance:** This single partnership gives access to majority of Saudi manufacturing sector.

## Sales Motion Implications

### 2026 Focus (Current Year)
**Primary Goal:** Build 10 reference clients

**Why:** Need proof points before Intek and other integrators commit to channel partnership.

**Implication for BD:**
- Quality > Quantity (10 great clients, not 100 mediocre ones)
- Case study mindset (document success stories)
- Vertical diversity (prove we work across industries)
- Geographic coverage (different MODON cities if possible)

**Target Client Size:** Mid-to-large manufacturers with:
- 50+ employees
- Multi-million SAR annual revenue
- Digital transformation budget
- Receptive to Industry 4.0 / SIRI

### 2027-2028 Channel Build
Once Intek partnership closes:
- Direct sales team shifts to partner enablement
- Marketing focuses on integrator support
- Product roadmap influenced by Intek feedback

## Financial Metrics to Track

### Revenue Targets
- 2026: 6.23M SAR (Q1: 1.5M | Q2: 1.5M | Q3: 1.6M | Q4: 1.6M estimate)
- 2027: 12.4M SAR (need to double revenue)

### EBITDA Margin Recovery
- 2025: -11% (R&D year)
- 2026: 21% (breakeven + profitability return)
- 2027: 31% (scale benefits kicking in)

### Key Ratios
- **Gross margin:** Not specified (need P&L detail)
- **R&D as % of revenue:** High in 2025 (platform dev), declining 2026+
- **Sales efficiency:** TBD (revenue per sales rep)

---

## IPO Path (2030)

### Nomu Exchange Target
**Nomu:** Saudi parallel stock market (smaller companies, SME focus)

**Requirements (general):**
- Minimum 3 years operational history ✅ (founded 2023)
- Profitability track record (need consecutive profitable years)
- Minimum paid-up capital (likely met with current valuation)
- 30%+ free float (investor shares)

**Timeline:**
- **2026-2027:** Build reference clients, prove channel model
- **2028:** Scale via integrators, expand to 25M SAR revenue
- **2029:** Demonstrate 47M SAR revenue, 62% EBITDA margin
- **2030:** Hit 100M SAR, 76% EBITDA - IPO ready

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Hit revenue targets (especially 2028-2029 ramp)
2. Maintain EBITDA margin expansion (62% → 76%)
3. Prove channel model scales (60% integrator by 2030)
4. Demonstrate recurring revenue (SaaS/subscription model)
5. No governance/compliance issues

## Strategic Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Intek Partnership Delays
**Impact:** Channel revenue lower than forecast
**Mitigation:** Build alternate regional SIs in parallel, don't rely solely on Intek

### Risk: Reference Client Acquisition Slower Than Expected
**Impact:** 2026 revenue miss, delays channel partnerships
**Mitigation:** Aggressive BD focus Q1-Q2 2026, use ministry certification actively

### Risk: EBITDA Margin Doesn't Recover as Planned
**Impact:** IPO valuation lower, less attractive to investors
**Mitigation:** Cost discipline, platform leverage (low marginal cost per customer)

### Risk: Competition (International MES Providers)
**Impact:** Price pressure, win rate decline
**Mitigation:** Ministry certification moat, government incentives, local advantage

### Competitive Positioning
- Lead with **Ministry certification** (unique differentiator)
- Emphasize **government backing** (reduces buyer risk)
- Highlight **local advantage** (vs international vendors)
