## 🔴 URGENT: Module-Based Pricing Model
**Status:** Meeting happened Feb 4 with Adil, Hamad, Amr
**What changed:** Lost Print-to-Pack because we proposed full MES when client wanted OEE only.
**New strategy:**
- Separate modules: OEE, Scheduling, Planning, Reports
- Match client requirements exactly (don't upsell)
- Clear separation: license cost vs implementation cost
- OEE module alone ~50-100K (vs 150K full suite)
**Timeline:**
- ~~Today: Finalize structure~~ ✅ Done
- Tomorrow (Feb 5): Review and approve
- Next week: 3 new proposals using new model
**Related:** Hamad's standardized evaluation form must be used for all projects
