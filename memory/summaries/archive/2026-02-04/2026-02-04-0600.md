**Period:** 00:00 - 06:00 UTC
**Generated:** 2026-02-04 06:00 UTC

## Summary

**Day 5** — Wednesday
## ✅ RESOLVED: Token Threshold Monitor (04:50 UTC)
**Previous issue (03:15):** Thought hook wasn't loading - no warnings seen at 69k tokens
**Resolution:** Hook WAS working, verified from logs at `/root/.openclaw/logs/token-monitor.log`:
**What happened:** Different sessions (main vs telegram DM) - warnings were firing on correct session
**Lesson:** Check ALL sessions' logs before assuming failure
