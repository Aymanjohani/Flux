## Summary

## 🔥 Today's Critical Actions
### 🔴 CRITICAL: Session Persistence Bug (09:55 UTC)
**Problem:** Telegram disconnects causing complete context loss
- **What happened:** Multiple times today - Telegram disconnected, new session created
- **Root cause:** OpenClaw has no peer → session mapping/restore logic
- **Impact:** Lost conversations regardless of token count (can't be solved by checkpoints alone)
**Session evidence:**
- 09:00 UTC: Session at 78k tokens discussing "option 2" solution
- 09:42 UTC: Telegram disconnects
- 09:44 UTC: New session created (lost entire conversation about this exact problem)
**Solution:** Build session-persistence hook (like token-threshold-monitor)
- Just like we built the token threshold hook ourselves, we'll build this
- Maintain peer_id → session_key mapping
- On reconnect → restore existing session instead of creating new one
- Store mapping in persistent file (survives gateway restarts)
**Status:** 🟡 Problem documented, solution designed
- **File created:** `memory/problems/session-persistence-on-reconnect.md`
- **Next step:** Build the hook (study token-threshold-monitor structure)
**Three implementation options:**
**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 - hook implementation (cleanest, most portable)
