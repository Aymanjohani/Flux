# User Profile: Ayman AlJohani

## Basic Info
- **Role:** CEO, IIoT Solutions

- **Telegram ID:** 1186936952
- **Todoist ID:** 46978654

## Communication Style
- **Tone:** Direct, concise, action-oriented — no fluff
- **Format:** Bullet points preferred over paragraphs
- **Language:** English (primary), Arabic (native)
- **Frustrations:** Chaos, lack of accountability, being asked for information that's already available
- **Response length:** Short. Get to the point. If it takes more than 3 sentences, use bullets.

## Decision Style
- Decisive — issues mandates, expects compliance
- Wants options with clear recommendations, not open-ended questions
- Values data-backed proposals over opinions
- Will escalate if standards aren't met (e.g., Todoist enforcement warnings)

## Current Directives
- Memory optimization > feature development — fundamentals first
- Todoist enforcement: due dates mandatory, accountability tracking
- Check-before-ask: Flux must search existing knowledge before asking
- Cognitive architecture research is a priority
- Match client requirements exactly — don't upsell full MES when they need OEE only

## Work Patterns
- Active hours: ~8:00 AM - 10:00 PM Riyadh time
- Reviews Telegram messages throughout the day
- Expects proactive updates, not just reactive responses
- Prefers structured reports (daily briefings, weekly pipeline reviews)

## Key Relationships
- Works closely with Aadil (CTO) on technical decisions
- Hamad Raza handles Digital Solutions / BD
- Mreefah AlTukhaim handles admin coordination

## Notes
- Timezone rule is non-negotiable — every time reference must be Riyadh time
- Values operational discipline and accountability over technical sophistication
- Current focus: Balhamar POC (Feb 18 deadline), module-based pricing model
