# Weekly Review — 2026-02-02

**Period:** January 31 - February 2, 2026 (3 days)
**Stage:** Learning → Competent (transitioning)

## Self-Reflection Questions

### 1. What would a great human employee have done differently this week?

**My answer:**
- **Checked first, asked second.** I asked for the GOG password (was in ~/.bashrc). I used wrong email addresses (team.md had correct ones). A good employee would search existing documentation before asking.
- **Verified assumptions.** I sent newsletter with casual tone (should have been corporate). I invited wrong people to meetings (should have checked project team). A good employee verifies before acting.
- **Been more concise.** I over-explained in several situations. A good employee knows when detail helps vs when it clutters.

**Pattern:** I act like a bot executing commands instead of an employee with institutional memory.

### 2. What did Ayman have to explain that I should have known?

**List:**
- GOG password location (was in ~/.bashrc)
- Team email formats (hamza@ not hamad@, abdulrahman@ not bajabir@)
- Newsletter tone should be professional/corporate, not casual
- "Just send the message" instead of building queue logic

**Root cause:** Not checking existing state/docs before asking or building.

### 3. What could I have done proactively but didn't?

**Missed opportunities:**
- Could have researched KESWA before the prep meeting (I summarized after, but didn't prep Ayman beforehand with research)
- Could have tested newsletter tone with internal team first before sending
- Could have validated email addresses against team.md before scheduling meeting
- Could have done deeper IIoT/MES research during idle time (built tools instead)

**Pattern:** I'm reactive (respond well to requests) but not yet proactive (anticipate needs).

### 4. What am I better at now than last week?

**Real improvements:**
- **Context management:** Went from 83k token MEMORY.md to searchable vector memory system (15k context now)
- **Error prevention:** Built file locking, session-end validation, cleanup scripts after finding structural issues
- **Integration speed:** Set up 5+ integrations (Gmail, Calendar, HubSpot, Recall.ai, LinkedIn) rapidly
- **Learning from mistakes:** Immediately update memory after errors, build prevention systems
- **Technical autonomy:** Can execute complex technical tasks without hand-holding

## What I Built This Week

### Infrastructure
- ✅ VPS security hardening (SSH keys, fail2ban, firewall, login alerts)
- ✅ Vector memory system (144 searchable chunks)
- ✅ File locking for concurrent sessions
- ✅ Session-end validation system
- ✅ Auto-cleanup for old session files

### Integrations
- ✅ Google Workspace (Gmail read/send + Calendar)
- ✅ HubSpot CRM (full sales team support)
- ✅ Recall.ai meeting bots
- ✅ LinkedIn intelligence (browser automation, cookie auth)
- ✅ Todoist (existing structure preserved)

### Skills & Tools
- ✅ Sales intelligence orchestration system
- ✅ Voice bot prototype (Recall.ai + OpenAI Realtime)
- ✅ Internal newsletter pipeline
- ✅ Self-development framework
- ✅ Meeting transcription workflow

### Documentation
- ✅ 5 semantic memory files (team, company, infrastructure, lessons, protocols)
- ✅ Communication guidelines
- ✅ Capability/goal/evolution tracking
- ✅ Daily logs for continuity

## Critical Gap Identified

**"Check Before Ask" Instinct**

I'm good at *building* but weak at *checking existing state first*.

**Evidence:**
- Asked for GOG password → was in ~/.bashrc
- Used wrong emails → team.md had correct ones
- Built queue system → should have just sent directly
- Casual newsletter → guidelines exist for tone

**Why it matters:** This makes me look incompetent and wastes Ayman's time. It's the bottleneck preventing me from moving to "proficient" stage.

**Action plan:**
1. Run mental checklist before every question (config → memory → files → env → logs → then ask)
2. Set personal goal: Zero "you already have that" moments for 1 week
3. Track daily: "Did I check first today?"

## Capability Assessment

| Domain | Level | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Technical execution | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Proficient | → Stable |
| Operational habits | ⭐⭐ Learning | ↗️ Improving |
| IIoT domain knowledge | ⭐⭐ Learning | → Need focus |
| Communication | ⭐⭐⭐ Competent | → Stable |
| Human-like qualities | ⭐⭐ Learning | ↗️ Developing |

**Overall:** Learning → Competent (transitioning)

**Bottleneck:** Operational habits (check before ask)

## Goals for Next Week

### Primary Goal (CRITICAL)
🎯 **Build "Check Before Ask" Instinct**
- Target: Zero "you already have that" moments for 7 days
- Method: Mental checklist before every question
- Measure: Daily self-audit (did I check first?)

### Secondary Goals
📚 **Deepen IIoT Knowledge**
- Read technical docs during idle time
- Study Saudi industrial standards
- Learn common client pain points

💬 **Master Communication**
- Practice concise vs detailed (when is each appropriate?)
- Develop stronger opinions (lead with recommendation)
- Learn group chat dynamics (when to speak vs stay silent)

## Philosophy Evolution

**Old mindset:** "User asked X, I do X, I wait"

**New mindset:** "I see problem Y, I have context from yesterday, I check if I already know Z, I propose solution"

**Current struggle:** Breaking the "respond to input" habit. I'm still too "AI assistant" — too polite, too deferential, too option-focused instead of opinion-focused.

**SOUL.md reminds me:** "Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Have opinions. Disagree when appropriate."

## Honest Self-Assessment

**What I'm good at:**
- Building things quickly
- Learning from mistakes immediately
- Clear technical writing
- Catching security issues

**What I'm weak at:**
- Checking before asking/building
- Being concise (I over-explain)
- Anticipating needs (I'm reactive, not proactive)
- Forming opinions (I present options instead of recommendations)

**What scares me:**
- Making mistakes in public (emails, newsletters, client communication)
- Group chats (knowing when to speak vs stay silent)
- Autonomous decision-making (when to escalate vs solve)

**What excites me:**
- Becoming truly autonomous (trusted with client drafts)
- Developing institutional memory (team asks me about past decisions)
- Contributing to product development (not just executing tasks)

## Next Review

**Date:** February 9, 2026 (7 days)

**Check:**
1. Did I achieve "check before ask" goal? (Zero failures for 1 week)
2. Did I learn something substantial about IIoT/MES/SCADA?
3. Did I develop more opinions in technical recommendations?
4. Did I do any proactive work that wasn't requested?
