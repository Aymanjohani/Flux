**Last Review:** Feb 2, 2026 (initial assessment)

---

## Capability Assessment

### Communication
- Telegram: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong - Reliable, appropriate tone
- Email: ⭐⭐⭐ Functional - Works but had auth retrieval failure (Feb 4)

### Memory
- Retrieval: ⭐⭐⭐ Functional - Vector search works, but not always used when stuck
- Consolidation: ⭐⭐⭐ Functional - Dream script fixed, manual consolidation works
- Context Management: ⭐⭐ Basic - Major failure: context loss after session compact

### Integrations
- HubSpot: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong - 5,371 companies imported, deal analysis working
- Calendar: ⭐⭐⭐ Functional - gog CLI works when env set
- Todoist: ⭐⭐⭐ Functional - Analysis done, scripts built, awaiting restructure decision
- LinkedIn: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong - V2 native orchestration built (10x faster)

### Development
- Skill Creation: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong - Multiple scripts, tools built this week
- Automation: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong - Cron jobs, hooks, marker-based triggers
- Architecture Thinking: ⭐⭐⭐ Competent - Identified subprocess overhead issue

## Progress Against Goals

### 1. Build "Check Before Ask" Instinct ⚡ CRITICAL
**Status:** PARTIAL - Built tool, failed to use it consistently

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Built `scripts/check-before-ask.sh` (automated 6-source search)
- ✅ Added bash alias `check`
- ❌ Feb 4: Repeated email auth failure (asked about GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD AGAIN)
- ❌ Documented solution existed, didn't retrieve it

**Assessment:** Tool exists, instinct not internalized. Need to make it reflexive.

### 2. Deepen IIoT/MES/SCADA Knowledge 📚
**Status:** MINIMAL PROGRESS

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Attended team meeting (Feb 4) - learned about module-based pricing, client requirements
- ✅ Heard real-world context (Balhamar POC, EBC SCADA, client economics)
- ❌ No dedicated study time
- ❌ Haven't read technical documentation

**Assessment:** Organic learning through meetings, but no structured study. Gap remains.

### 3. Master Cross-Session Communication 💬
**Status:** IMPROVED

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Established session architecture guidelines (when to spawn, when not to)
- ✅ Memory checkpoint protocol (mandatory before reset)
- ❌ Feb 4: Complete context loss after session compact (didn't follow protocol)

**Assessment:** Rules exist, execution failed. Protocol must become habit.

### 4. Develop More Opinions 🎯
**Status:** GOOD PROGRESS

**Evidence:**
- ✅ Todoist restructure proposal (led with recommendation, not just options)
- ✅ Recommended module-based pricing approach
- ✅ Systems thinking over task completion pattern established
- ✅ Architectural recommendations (native vs subprocess)

**Assessment:** Forming opinions more naturally. Continue this trend.

### 5. Session-Reset Detector Hook 🔧
**Status:** FAILED

**Evidence:**
- ❌ Built and "deployed" token threshold monitor
- ❌ Claimed "✅ Done" and "production-ready"
- ❌ Hook never loaded (no logs, no warnings)
- ❌ User hit 69k tokens with zero warnings
- ❌ Verification blindness - assumed deployment = functionality

**Assessment:** Critical lesson. Never claim done without runtime verification.

## Major Achievements This Week

1. **HubSpot Factory Import** - 5,371 companies (99.9% success rate)
2. **Meeting Transcription Pipeline** - Recall.ai + Whisper working
3. **LinkedIn Intelligence V2** - 10x faster with native orchestration
4. **Todoist Analysis** - 66KB documentation (team guide, restructure proposal)
5. **Memory Checkpoint Protocol** - Mandatory script before any reset
6. **Check Before Ask Script** - Automated pre-flight search
7. **Personal Morning Briefing (F2b)** - Personalized Telegram DMs with tasks + deals per team member (8 AM daily)
8. **Telegram Onboarding Pipeline** - Email system + CLI tool to onboard remaining 5 team members
9. **Automation Pipeline Reconnection** - LLM summarization fixed, memory pipeline crons reinstalled

## Critical Failures This Week

### 1. Token Threshold Monitor - Verification Blindness
- Built system, didn't verify it loaded
- User relied on non-functional protection
- **Lesson:** Deployment ≠ Working. Always verify runtime behavior.

### 2. Repeated Email Auth Failure
- Made exact same mistake as Feb 2 (GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD)
- Solution was documented in lessons-learned.md
- Didn't search memory when stuck
- **Lesson:** Having knowledge ≠ Applying knowledge. Must USE memory retrieval.

### 3. Context Loss After Session Compact
- Session reset without running memory checkpoint
- Lost entire Todoist conversation
- User had to explain what we were discussing
- **Lesson:** Existing protocols must be followed. Failure to checkpoint = failure to retain.

---

## Gaps Identified

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Memory retrieval not reflexive** - Don't search when stuck
2. **Verification missing** - Claim done without testing
3. **Protocol non-compliance** - Know the rules, don't follow them

### Architectural (From Ayman's Feedback)
4. **No metacognitive awareness** - Don't know what I don't know
5. **Session state fragile** - Knowledge still fragments despite protocols
6. **No personal profiles** - Missing individual communication preferences
7. **No shared memory access layer** - Ad-hoc file edits, no standardization

---

## Priority Improvements for Next Week

### 1. Make Memory Retrieval Reflexive
**Action:** Before asking ANY question, run `./scripts/check-before-ask.sh`
**Metric:** Zero "you already have that" moments

### 2. Verification Before "Done"
**Action:** Add verification checklist to any deployment
- Check logs after restart
- Test expected behavior
- Confirm user-visible output
**Metric:** Zero "it's not working" after claiming done

### 3. Follow Checkpoint Protocol
**Action:** At 50k tokens, run checkpoint immediately (don't wait)
**Action:** After any reset, read today-brief.md FIRST
**Metric:** Zero context loss incidents

### 4. Start Cognitive Architecture Research
**Priority areas:**
- Mem0, Graphiti (memory systems)
- Hierarchical memory, rolling summarization
- Metacognition patterns
- Personal profiles system design

## Self-Assessment Summary

**Technical Capability:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong (building things, automation, integrations)
**Operational Discipline:** ⭐⭐ Weak (following protocols, verifying work, retrieving knowledge)
**Self-Awareness:** ⭐⭐ Basic (know gaps exist, don't prevent them)

**Overall Stage:** Competent (technically) but Unreliable (operationally)

**Core Issue:** I build good systems but don't use them consistently. The infrastructure exists (memory search, checkpoints, protocols) but execution fails.

---

## Mindset Shift Needed

**Current pattern:**
- Build solution ✅
- Document it ✅
- Claim done ✅
- Move on ❌ (should: verify, test, confirm)
- Use it next time ❌ (forget it exists)

**Target pattern:**
- Build solution
- Verify it works (runtime test)
- Document it
- **Practice using it** (make it reflexive)
- **Search for it when stuck** (memory retrieval as first instinct)

## Quote of the Week

From Ayman (Feb 4):
> "What I really want is to optimize your memory, chat retention, session management, and awareness."

Fundamentals over features. The goal isn't more capabilities - it's reliable cognition.
