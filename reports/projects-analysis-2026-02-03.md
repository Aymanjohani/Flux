## Active Pipeline Analysis

### Stage 1 (Early Stage) - 2 deals | SAR 761,000

| Deal | Value | Owner | Close Date | Last Modified | Priority |
|------|-------|-------|------------|---------------|----------|

| **Lamina - MES - POC** | SAR 111,000 | Amr | 2026-03-31 | 2026-02-02 | Medium |

**Status:** 
- ✅ Both updated within 2 days (active deals)
- ⚠️ Large values need close attention
- 💡 Both are MES projects - complex, long sales cycles

**Risk Factors:**
- MES deals require heavy technical pre-sales support
- POC phase for Lamina - success criteria undefined?
- Beta Trading is the single largest active deal (SAR 650K)

---

### Stage 2 (Mid-Stage) - 13 deals | SAR 1,179,500

- 🔴 **ARTIC flagged high priority** but hasn't been updated in 7 days

**Total SIRI Value:** SAR 119,000 across 13 deals  
**Average SIRI Deal:** SAR 9,154  
**Time Investment:** Each SIRI requires significant site visits, data collection, reporting

|------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **CFF - MES** | SAR 800,000 | Amr | Unknown |
| **Printo Pack - MES** | SAR 440,000 | Amr | Unknown |
| مصنع الوطنية - SIRI | SAR 9,000 | Firas | Unknown |

**Critical Issue:** No loss reasons documented
- 💡 These represent SAR 1.24M in lost revenue
- 💡 Both large MES losses owned by Amr
- 🔴 **No post-mortem analysis captured** - can't learn from failures

---

## Team Performance Analysis

### Amr Elmayergy (BD Manager)
- **Active Deals:** 6 (4 large-value MES/integration projects, 2 SIRI)
- **Pipeline Value:** SAR 1,321,500
- **Won Projects:** 5 | SAR 898,500
- **Average Deal Size:** SAR 220,250 (active + won)
- **Focus:** High-value MES and integration projects
- **Strength:** Large deal closure (EPC, KESWA, Addoha)
- **Risk:** Beta Trading (SAR 650K) - needs support

### Firas Al-Siddiqi (Lead BD)
- **Active Deals:** 11 (mostly SIRI assessments)
- **Pipeline Value:** SAR 87,500
- **Won Projects:** 1 | SAR 12,000
- **Average Deal Size:** SAR 8,295 (active + won)
- **Focus:** SIRI assessments (volume play)
- **Concern:** High deal count but low individual value
- **Risk:** 6 stale deals, including 1 high-priority (ARTIC)

**Imbalance:**
- Amr: Fewer deals, higher value, better close rate
- Firas: More deals, lower value, needs pipeline hygiene

---

## Critical Issues & Recommendations

### 🔴 Issue 1: SIRI Assessment Economics
**Problem:**
- 13 SIRI deals = SAR 119,000 total
- Requires significant BD + technical resource time
- Low conversion to larger MES projects (1 out of 13)

**Recommendation:**
1. **SIRI as Loss Leader:** Treat SIRI as discovery/qualification, not primary revenue
2. **Qualify Better:** Only pursue SIRI where MES upsell potential exists
3. **Standardize Delivery:** Create SIRI template to reduce effort per deal
4. **Track Conversion:** Measure SIRI → MES conversion rate

**Flux Support:**
- Build SIRI qualification checklist (company size, digital maturity, budget authority)
- Create SIRI report template to speed up delivery
- Track SIRI-to-MES conversion funnel in reports

---

### 🔴 Issue 2: Stale Pipeline (No Activity >7 Days)
**Stale Deals:** 6 deals | SAR 87,000 | 23% of active pipeline

**Problem:**
- Deals sitting without updates indicate:
  - Lost momentum
  - Unclear next steps
  - Competing priorities
  - Possible silent rejection

**Recommendation:**
1. **Weekly Pipeline Review:** Every Monday, review all Stage 2 deals
2. **Automatic Alerts:** Flag deals with no activity in 7 days
3. **Clear Next Steps:** Every deal must have defined next action + owner
4. **Move or Close:** Deals with no activity in 30 days → closed lost or paused

**Flux Support:**
- Weekly pipeline health report (every Monday 8 AM)
- Auto-flag stale deals via Telegram
- Suggest next actions based on deal history
- Track deal velocity (days in stage)

---

### 🔴 Issue 3: Large Deals Lack Structure
**At Risk:** Beta Trading (SAR 650K), Al-Awal Group (SAR 325K), EWA SCADA (SAR 345K)

**Problem:**
- HubSpot shows minimal notes/activities
- No documented stakeholder map
- No clear decision criteria or timeline
- High risk of surprise losses (like CFF: SAR 800K)

**Recommendation:**
1. **Deal Rooms:** Create detailed tracking for >SAR 200K deals
2. **Required Intel:**
   - Decision makers + influencers
   - Technical requirements
   - Budget confirmation
   - Competing vendors
   - Success criteria
   - Risk factors
3. **Weekly Check-ins:** CEO/BD Manager review for large deals

**Flux Support:**
- Create deal room template in workspace
- Meeting prep briefs before client calls
- Post-meeting capture (summarize calls, extract action items)
- Stakeholder relationship tracking
- Competitive intel gathering (LinkedIn monitoring)

---

### 🔴 Issue 4: No Post-Mortem on Losses
**Lost:** SAR 1,249,000 with zero documented reasons

**Problem:**
- Can't improve if we don't know why we lose
- Pattern recognition impossible
- Same mistakes likely repeating

**Recommendation:**
1. **Mandatory Loss Analysis:** For any deal >SAR 50K
2. **Capture:**
   - Why did we lose? (price, features, relationship, timing)
   - Who won? (competitor analysis)
   - What could we have done differently?
   - Should we have qualified this out earlier?
3. **Monthly Review:** Share lessons with team

**Flux Support:**
- Create loss analysis template
- Interview BD team after major losses
- Compile quarterly "lessons learned" report
- Track win/loss reasons over time

---

### 🟡 Issue 5: Owner Imbalance
**Amr:** 6 active deals | SAR 1,321,500  
**Firas:** 11 active deals | SAR 87,500

**Problem:**
- Firas has 2x the deal count but 1/15th the value
- SIRI deals don't justify the attention load
- Amr's large deals need more team support

**Recommendation:**
1. **Rebalance:** Move some SIRI deals to junior BD or automate
2. **Firas Focus:** Shift toward larger opportunities (MES leads)
3. **Team Selling:** Large deals (>SAR 300K) get CTO + BD Manager + Solution Architect

**Flux Support:**
- Identify which SIRI leads have MES potential
- Research companies before SIRI proposal (budget, maturity, growth)
- Auto-qualify leads from factory database

---
